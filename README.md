# tigerbeetle

*TigerBeetle is a financial accounting database designed for mission critical safety and performance to power the future of financial services.*

TigerBeetle is not yet production-ready. In particular, the protocol and data file formats may change and [might not be compatible across different commits](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/issues/1109), while we fine-tune the format ahead of release.

The production version of **TigerBeetle is now under active development**.

## Quickstart

First, download a prebuilt copy of TigerBeetle.

On macOS/Linux:

```console
git clone https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle; cd tigerbeetle; ./bootstrap.sh
```

On Windows:

```console
git clone https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle; cd tigerbeetle; .\bootstrap.ps1
```

Want to build from source locally? Add `-build` as an argument to the bootstrap script.

#### Running TigerBeetle

Then create the TigerBeetle data file.

```console
./tigerbeetle format --cluster=0 --replica=0 --replica-count=1 0_0.tigerbeetle
```
```console
info(io): creating "0_0.tigerbeetle"...
info(io): allocating 660.140625MiB...
```

And start the replica.

```console
./tigerbeetle start --addresses=3000 0_0.tigerbeetle
```
```console
info(io): opening "0_0.tigerbeetle"...
info(main): 0: cluster=0: listening on 127.0.0.1:3000
```

### Using the CLI Client

Now that you've got a cluster running, let's connect to it and do some
accounting!

First let's create two accounts. (Don't worry about the details, you
can read about them later.)

```console
./tigerbeetle client --cluster=0 --addresses=3000
```
```console
TigerBeetle Client
  Hit enter after a semicolon to run a command.

Examples:
  create_accounts id=1 code=10 ledger=700,
                  id=2 code=10 ledger=700;
  create_transfers id=1 debit_account_id=1 credit_account_id=2 amount=10 ledger=700 code=10;
  lookup_accounts id=1;
  lookup_accounts id=1, id=2;
```
```console
create_accounts id=1 code=10 ledger=700,
                id=2 code=10 ledger=700;
```
```console
info(message_bus): connected to replica 0
```

Now create a transfer of `10` (of some amount/currency) between the two accounts.

```console
create_transfers id=1 debit_account_id=1 credit_account_id=2 amount=10 ledger=700 code=10;
```

Now, the amount of `10` has been credited to account `2` and debited
from account `1`. Let's query TigerBeetle for these two accounts to
verify!

```console
lookup_accounts id=1, id=2;
```
```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "user_data": "0",
  "ledger": "700",
  "code": "10",
  "flags": "",
  "debits_pending": "0",
  "debits_posted": "10",
  "credits_pending": "0",
  "credits_posted": "0"
}
{
  "id": "2",
  "user_data": "0",
  "ledger": "700",
  "code": "10",
  "flags": "",
  "debits_pending": "0",
  "debits_posted": "0",
  "credits_pending": "0",
  "credits_posted": "10"
}
```

And indeed you can see that account `1` has `debits_posted` as `10`
and account `2` has `credits_posted` as `10`. The `10` amount is fully
accounted for!

## Benchmarks

First grab the sources and run the setup script:

```console
git clone https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle.git
cd tigerbeetle
scripts/install.sh
```

With TigerBeetle installed, you are ready to benchmark!

```console
scripts/benchmark.sh
